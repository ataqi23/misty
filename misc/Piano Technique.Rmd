## Form

-Height of stool : Belly button should be around the white keys.

-Chair-piano distance: Your 'behind' should be covering $\approx \frac{1}{3}$ of the stool.

-Arms extended: should be able to barely reach the backboard of the piano, given the $\textbf{chair-piano distance}$ previously adjusted.

-Elbows: should be in front of the ribcage.

-Center of gravity: is determined by the $1/3$ coverage of the chair, so use the torso to lean/sink into the keyboard gesturally. You can also call this tipping forward into the keys, ideally this is without forcing it.

## Technique

-Octave leaps, especially hollow ones need not involve lifting the hand in the air too much. Basically, stay close to the keys.

-Minimize wrist motion: tremolos, especially those of small intervals ($\leq 9$ semitones) need almost no wrist motion.

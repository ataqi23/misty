To-Do List

(scales.py)
- Add a Mode feature, potentially by generalizing the transpose_notes.
- Generalize transpose_notes to a non-12 note scale. Either use length(notes) if default is NONE; and use as an argument (may be useful for the chronological COF k-subscales.
- Initialize the Diatonic Modes as a test.
- For modes, possibly create a Âµ-indexed function that returns the mode given the Lydian root scale?
- Implement the Symmetric scales.
  
(fifths.py)
- Figure out why 'import scales' is not working.
- Add pentatonic scales, more generally, a k-subscale of the COF.

(chords.py)
- Create a tertiary n-stack feature of diatonic scales. (k=0 yields thirds, k=1 triads, k=2 sevenths, etc. until 13th chords)
- Inversion feature to enumerate all possible chronological inversions of a chord.

(tuning.py)
- Create a pitch continuum class.
- Implement n-TET tuning systems about some tuning frequency.
- Need to create some octave labelling scheme.
